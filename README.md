# Analyze-City-Data-Using-R-and-Tableau

In this Project, I have:

* Used R and RStudio to create a function to make requests to the OpenStreeMaps.org API using address from the Kolkata buildings permits dataset.
* Explore and filter the Kolkata's buildings permits data. Transform it using basic string cleaning techniques to generate a new clean dataset.
* Leverage Tableau to analyze a dataset based on San Francisco's buildings permits dataset to gain insights on the metropolitan are development.

### Necessary steps that has been done to facilitate this project:
* Creating an R function to make REST API request to the OpenStreetMaps API
* Perform basic data cleaning and filtering techniques using R
* Preparing Queries and Making API Requests to the OpenStreetMaps API
* Buildings Permit Analysis in Tableau, working with Maps and Pages
